Data Descriptor: LoRa Network Performance Analysis in Indoor Buildings
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of a
conducted experiment that explores the performance and feasibility of LoRa (Long Range) technology within indoor building
environments. The experiment aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
and viability of LoRa communication in multiple locations within
an indoor building and evaluate the signal strength and reception
ratio of the LoRa communication in different areas and floors
of the building. A single LoRa device was used to transmit data,
while multiple receivers captured and recorded the received data.
The collected dataset underwent meticulous analysis to ensure
the reliability of the data. The findings provide insights into the
effectiveness of LoRa communication in indoor building scenarios
and offer valuable information for optimizing LoRa deployments
in similar environments.
